### What is itðŸ¤–?
- ðŸš— The purpose of this project is pushing the limits of deep neural networks to learn how to drive in the Los Santos City in GTA-V.
- ðŸš— This repository is using PyTorch for deep learning models. And state-of-art EfficientnetV-2 gen models that achieves better accuracy compared to other models.
- ðŸš— This repository is newer version of Sentdex's ['youtube.com/sentdex'] PyGTA5 ['github.com/sentdex/pygta5'] series.
- ðŸš— You can learn more about the project at Sentdex's tutorial series: ['pythonprogramming.net/game-frames-open-cv-python-plays-gta-v/']
- ðŸš— He also has a website for his experiences about training the model: ['psyber.io']
- ðŸš— If you have anything to add/share email me: selfdrivingcar1@gmail.com
- ðŸš— 69K+ Frames (dataset) that mapped to keypresses and the trained models will be available soon!
